## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

The dataset contains historical retail sales data from 45  stores , each with various departments. It includes:

- **Weekly sales figures**
- **Store-level variables** (e.g., markdowns, economic indicators, holidays)
- **Store type and size classifications**

Promotional markdowns were applied ahead of major holidays like **Labor Day, Fatherâ€™s Day, Motherâ€™s Day, and Christmas**, and these **holiday weeks are weighted 5Ã— higher** in evaluations due to their business impact.

The dataset is structured into three tabs:

1. **Variables Dataset** â€“ Economic and promotional indicators by store and week
2. **Weekly Sales Data** â€“ Sales per department per store per week
3. **Store Type & Size** â€“ Metadata about each store
